Never done an Escape Room before? You can learn more about them here: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_room>

If you're interested in joining me, you can sign up using the form above. You can also use this form to signal more general interest, if you aren't sure you can make it.

I have no idea how many folks will be interested in this, so I can't make a promise about there being space for everyone. I can only guarantee that I will be there. I'll do my best to coordinate things with whoever fills out the form via text once we get to SIGCSE!
