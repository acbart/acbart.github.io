# SIGCSE Escapes

Hi!

Do you like Escape Rooms? I sure do. While we're in Toronto CA for SIGCSE'23, I plan to do an Escape Room. If you'd like to join me, keep reading!

* **Sign-up Form**: <https://forms.gle/LemJT4vnJZzSttSW9>
* **Where**: The Escape Manor (Toronto)
* **URL**: <https://www.escapemanor.com/toronto>
* **How Far**: 7 minute walk from the Conference Center <https://goo.gl/maps/T33S7S9Hnnqeh731A>
* **Cost**: $36 per person
* **When and Which Rooms**: TBD
* **Meeting**: If you wish to walk with us, we will depart from where the Registration Booth was in the Conference Center at ____

Never done an Escape Room before? You can learn more about them here: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_room>


If you're interested in joining me, you can sign up using the form above. You can also use this form to signal more general interest. Perhaps we will make a bigger plan for SIGCSE'24! Escape Room companies can often host large corporate events!

I have no idea how many folks will be interested in this, so I can't make a promise about there being space for everyone. I can only guarantee that I will be there. I'll do my best to coordinate things with whoever fills out the form via text once we get to SIGCSE!
