# Ongoing Projects

## PEDAL

A Pedagogical Library for analyzing student's Python work and delivering feedback. Uses various tools including a type inferencer, flow analyzer, and code pattern matching.

## CORGIS

Many Introductory Computer Science courses rely on abstract problems, which clashes with students' experiences in a media and data-rich world. By using real data sources, academic problems are contextualized, thereby

* increasing students' motivation,
* connecting more deeply with students' prior knowledge, and
* providing grounded experience in more advanced topics.

However, there are drawbacks to using these data sources:

* periodic instability,
* inconstant availability of "useful data",
* the potential for corrupted data,
* and many more.

To overcome these challenges, we've created:

* A set of libraries that make introducing big data trivial,
* A friendly web gallery of these tools,
* A useful online tool for quickly prototyping new libraries.

Developed under [Dr. Eli Tilevich](http://people.cs.vt.edu/~tilevich/),[Dr. Cliff Shaffer](http://people.cs.vt.edu/~shaffer/), and [Dr. Dennis Kafura](http://people.cs.vt.edu/~kafura/) as part of two [NSF Grant](http://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=1140318)s.

## BlockPy

![BlockPy Logo](/images/blockpy-logo-small.png)

[BlockPy](http://think.cs.vt.edu/blockpy) is a web-based Python environment that lets you work with blocks, text, or both. Designed for Data Science and equipped with powerful tools like the State Explorer and Guided Feedback, the goal of BlockPy is to let you solve authentic, real-world problems.

## Computational Thinking Class

I've helped to teach and develop a new course on "Computational Thinking" at Virginia Tech, emphasizing Abstractions and Algorithms through the use of Data Science. This takes advantage of both BlockPy and CORGIS. We've even been written up in a [local newspaper](http://www.roanoke.com/news/education/higher_education/virginia_tech/students-test-new-ways-of-teaching-and-learning-at-virginia/article_dca00832-1328-5e74-9ba5-c0bbf62fb0fb.html)!

## Introductory Python Curriculum (Project SNEKS)

An instructionally designed curriculum for teaching intro python, open-sourced and accessible for instructors to adopt.

# Potential Projects

Are you an undergraduate interested in doing research with me? Here are some topics and areas that are interesting to me.

## Superior Dual Block/Text Interface

## Programming Typing Tutor Game

* Students type code from real repositories
* Based on language-theories of learning to program
* Uses AST filtering to only provide code suitable to the student's current level
* [[HCI]] [[Program Analysis]] [[Web Applications]]

## Canvas Management Tools

* Various tools for synchronizing a Canvas course with a Github repo
* Web interface to simplify comparisons and diff resolutions
* Interfaces for generating reports, managing TAs, and setting course options.
