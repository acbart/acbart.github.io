Many Introductory Computer Science courses rely on abstract problems, which clashes with students' experiences in a media and data-rich world. By using real data sources, academic problems are contextualized, thereby

* increasing students' motivation,
* connecting more deeply with students' prior knowledge, and
* providing grounded experience in more advanced topics.

However, there are drawbacks to using these data sources:

* periodic instability,
* inconstant availability of "useful data",
* the potential for corrupted data,
* and many more.

To overcome these challenges, we've created:

* A set of libraries that make introducing big data trivial,
* A friendly web gallery of these tools,
* A useful online tool for quickly prototyping new libraries.

Developed under [Dr. Eli Tilevich](http://people.cs.vt.edu/~tilevich/),[Dr. Cliff Shaffer](http://people.cs.vt.edu/~shaffer/), and [Dr. Dennis Kafura](http://people.cs.vt.edu/~kafura/) as part of two [NSF Grant](http://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=1140318)s.
