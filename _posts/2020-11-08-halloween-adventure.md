This has been a challenging semester for my students.
I am teaching CISC108, the introductory class for Computer Science majors.
The class is tough enough, even for many students with prior programming experience.
But, due to the Global Pandemic, this Fall 2020 semester is online.
In addition to my [existing curricular framework](https://acbart.github.io/python-sneks/), I have a lot of new course policies meant to make the experience easier: no exams, flexible deadlines, and a huge team of excellent TAs giving 12:1 attention.
But even with all this, my students are all still struggling to stay engaged.

I decided, on Thursday October 29, that I wanted to mix things up a little for Halloween.
It's always been my favorite holiday, and I have historically gone overboard with costumes and decorations.
But this year, I had something even more elaborate in mind for my students: an interactive adventure game experience.
When students logged into Zoom lecture, they were met with my empty chair and instructions to complete the classwork assignment on Canvas.

Prerecorded videos guided them to write code in BlockPy and eventually help rescue from my patio.
Nothing too terribly spooky, but I think it's still fitting for the season.
The video below captures the experience that my students had.
In the following sections, I describe how I put the whole thing together in a single (long) night.

# How I Did It

Started working on it around 8pm, and finished around 3am.
