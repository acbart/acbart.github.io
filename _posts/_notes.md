Regarding the **More Theory**: I think that this is wishful thinking. The hope is that removing all of the tedious syntax details, we can cover more material faster. This is a dream we've always wanted in CS1, and many educators are shocked to discover that we can't cover more in CS1. is a cruel wakeup call - most freshmen students cannot complete a "simple" coding question at the end of their CS1. Of course we'd like to be teaching more sophisticated concepts, but the reality is that most students are still struggling to learn the basics. But those basics are the foundation you build everything else on. If you don't have a solid foundation, you can't build anything else on top of it.

You can teach kids Hamlet by having them watch The Lion King, but that doesn't mean they have the tools to do a deep literary analysis and understand the themes and motifs of the play. Most of those critical thinking skills come from developing a close appreciation of the text. These things are messily entangled with each other, and pulling them apart is not as easy as the pro-AI folks think.
