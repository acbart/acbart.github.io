Never done an Escape Room before? You can learn more about them here: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_room>

I have no idea how many folks will be interested in this, so I can't make a promise about there being space for everyone. I can guarantee at least that I will be there. I'll do my best to coordinate things with whoever fills out the form. Though if you sign up and then don't show up, I probably won't want to collaborate with you in the future ;)

If you're interested in joining me, you can sign up using the form above. You can also use that form to signal more general interest. If there's enough demand, perhaps we can coordinate a different (or second?) timeslot that works for more people. Or perhaps make a bigger plan for SIGCSE'23! Escape Room companies can often host large corporate events!

One last thing while we're talking about Escape Rooms, you might be interested in attending my SIGCSE'22 Demo (#2C) on Thursday, March 3 at 15:00-15:45 in Exhibit Hall C/D (RICC): Let's Learn Algorithms with AlgoTutorBot! An Entire Course as an Educational Escape Room (read more about it here: <https://acbart.github.io/algotutorbot/>).
