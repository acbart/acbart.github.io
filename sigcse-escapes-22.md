# SIGCSE'22 Escapes

Hi!

Do you like Escape Rooms? I sure do. While we're in Providence RI for SIGCSE'22, I plan to do an Escape Room. If you'd like to join me, keep reading!

* **Sign-up Form**: <https://forms.gle/uAL9vRNxVATxydPw7>
* **Where**: The Great Escape Room
* **URL**: <https://thegreatescaperoom.com/providence>
* **How Far**: 7 minute walk from the Conference Center <https://goo.gl/maps/RUsjD8pQa3Mpk3dq5>
* **Cost**: $33 per adults, $29.70 for students/veterans
* **When**: The escape starts promptly at 2:40pm on Saturday March 5 and lasts for an hour
* **Which Room**: Poker Night at the President's Bunker (Up to 10 Players) <https://thegreatescaperoom.com/providence/rooms/bunker>
* **Meeting**: If you wish to walk with us, we will depart from where the Registration Booth was in the Rhode Island Convention Center at 2:25pm

Never done an Escape Room before? You can learn more about them here: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_room>

I have no idea how many folks will be interested in this, so I can't make a promise about there being space for everyone. I can guarantee at least that I will be there. I'll do my best to coordinate things with whoever fills out the form. Though if you sign up and then don't show up, I probably won't want to collaborate with you in the future ;)

If you're interested in joining me, you can sign up using the form above. You can also use that form to signal more general interest. If there's enough demand, perhaps we can coordinate a different (or second?) timeslot that works for more people. Or perhaps make a bigger plan for SIGCSE'23! Escape Room companies can often host large corporate events!

One last thing while we're talking about Escape Rooms, you might be interested in attending my SIGCSE'22 Demo (#2C) on Thursday, March 3 at 15:00-15:45 in Exhibit Hall C/D (RICC): Let's Learn Algorithms with AlgoTutorBot! An Entire Course as an Educational Escape Room (read more about it here: <https://acbart.github.io/algotutorbot/>).
