# Replit: Zero Setup Online Pair Coding on Any Device
<https://pathable.sigcse2021.org/meetings/virtual/PP3b3AcRanX23sET4>

Wednesday at 04:15PM until 05:30PM EDT

During extended periods of at-home learning, the equity gap of computing education access has been exacerbated further. Varying ability levels, home computer access, and internet access introduce new challenges for CS instructors to reach all students. Instructors are also placed in the precarious position of needing to address industry demands for students trained with pair programming skills. Hybrid learning that deliberately fosters a sense of comradery and intentional collaboration promises to improve student persistence and course outcomes. Replit Teams for Education presents an opportunity for instructors from all backgrounds to spend more time engaged in teaching rather than troubleshooting student environments and tediously sharing code. Attendees will experience first-hand how students can work together through Replt's collaborative coding environment and how to leverage Replit's unique technologies in their teaching practice.

# zyBooks: Empowering Educators with High Quality Auto Graded Assignments and Tools to Promote Academic Integrity
<https://pathable.sigcse2021.org/meetings/virtual/jBRkvd2b6LWg5KJQY>

Wednesday at 05:30PM until 06:45PM EDT

Nearly 80% of instructors who use zyLabs auto-grader switched from grading programming assignments by hand. They saved an average of 9 hours per week, with some reporting up to 20 hours saved.In recent years, computer science educators have increasingly shifted how they grade programming assignments, from grading manually or using batch scripts, to using auto-graders with immediate score feedback to students. zyBooks has been a pioneer by developing the zyLabs auto-grader, that is easy to use and integrated with our state of the art e-learning platform. This shift illustrates a future with a much different classroom dynamic, in which students view instructors less as evaluators and more as hands-on educators. To support educators in this new role, zyLabs also provides support across a wide range of activities by providing a library of high-quality pre-written programming assignments, an intuitive interface for customizing content, and tools to promote student integrity. In this session, we'll talk about the growth and benefits of zyLabs auto-grading, demonstrate our library of programming assignments, and illustrate how zyLabs features promote academic honesty.

# GitHub: Help Students Master Git & GitHub in 3 Lessons
<https://pathable.sigcse2021.org/meetings/virtual/ppkFwTbvhiNcTaufF>

Thursday at 03:00PM until 04:15PM EDT

Jeff has used Git & GitHub with students in both introductory and advanced high school courses, fine-tuning strategies for introducing Git in low-stakes and non-threatening ways and building to greater comfort & fluency over time. His strategies emphasize Git as a tool for project collaboration and personal organization, allowing Git to be integrated into your own projects & tasks no matter the programming language or IDE. Participants will see a lesson progression for developing understanding with Git & GitHub, including several Unplugged lesson ideas that can be done without computers. He'll also share his own journey through introducing Git to students, including pitfalls and strategies to avoid. Ultimately, even though Git is an industry standard tool for developers, Jeff doesn't think this should be the only reason for students to learn it his goal is to describe strategies & resources that can motivate all students to see GitHub as a useful tool in their own journey through computer science, even if this doesn't lead directly into a career in software development.

Every May, tens of thousands of high school students sit the AP Computer Science A (AP CS A) exam, testing their introductory programming knowledge and skills. So how would your introductory students perform on this exam? In this special session attendees will receive access to AP CS A multiple choice and free response (coding) questions and have the opportunity to judge whether or not their students could answer the questions correctly. In addition, the presenters will share how each question is mapped to specific Learning Outcomes and expected student skills, much like what must be done for ABET accreditation efforts. Attendees can expect to have their Java programming skills challenged, learn ways to construct exams to meet course learning outcomes, and development of rubrics that reinforce measurement of concept mastery.

<https://pathable.sigcse2021.org/meetings/virtual/HYsojoLooZL6WSb2S>

Friday at 01:00PM until 02:45PM EDT

Abstract from publication in ACM DL (SIGCSE TS 2020):The analysis of data plays an increasingly critical role in computing education research, enabled by more and larger datasets, more powerful analysis techniques and better infrastructure for sharing. This panel brings together four panellists at various stages of work involving the collection and analysis of large datasets in different fields of computing education. The panellists will each discuss the current state of their work, the unique aspects of their data, and how that data fits into the larger landscape of computing education and research. Panellists will be asked to explain how they are employing AI and data mining techniques to learn about learners, the research methods they have used to make this happen, and any significant key findings they have discovered through this processes. The panel will discuss emerging topics, including: going beyond log data, handling global-scale datasets, efficiently collaborating with cross-dataset analysis, and ethical and privacy considerations. After the panelists present (5 minutes each), the moderator will pose follow-up questions and invite the audience to pose additional questions or provide other feedback. Key takeaways will include how data mining and artificial intelligence can contribute to improved insight and learning gains and how the larger computer education community can participate in data collection or analysis.

<https://pathable.sigcse2021.org/meetings/virtual/7SiCJLh3hwnRWanrG>

Friday at 01:00PM until 02:45PM EDT

https://doi.org/10.1145/3408877.3432586In this session, members of the ACM Data Science (DS) Task Force will present the final draft of Computing Competencies for Undergraduate Data Science Programs. Drafting this document has been a three-year process, in which the task force has released preliminary drafts, sought input from the community, and responded to the community's helpful feedback. Our intent is that the session be an exchange that will clarify the contents of the report and provide participants with ways to put the report into practice at their own institutions. This session should be of interest to all SIGCSE attendees, but especially to faculty developing college-level curricula in Data Science.

# Panel: Teaching Computer Science with Abstract Strategy Games
<https://pathable.sigcse2021.org/meetings/virtual/MByPLjS4B6wA93Mks>

Friday at 08:00PM until 09:45PM EDT

https://doi.org/10.1145/3408877.3432572Abstract Strategy Games are games of no chance with complete information - all players (usually two) know all there is about the current position nothing is hidden. Examples of popular games are Tic-Tac-Toe, Chess, Checkers, Connect-4, Reversi, Mancala, Nim, Dots-and-Boxes, and Go there are thousands more. In addition to the cultural history and remarkably beautiful mathematics locked within the strategies and game trees, we have found they form a wonderfully fertile, rich, and engaging source of activities around which to teach fundamentals of computer science. This panel will explore the ways in which we have used these games with our students, through interactive tutorials and reflection that will each surface a particular CS concept. After sharing best practices, we will invite the audience to contribute their own experiences.

# Special Session: Nifty Web Apps: Build a Web App for Any Text-Based Programming Assignment
<https://pathable.sigcse2021.org/meetings/virtual/HrEBku4T8FmcENdju>

Friday at 08:00PM until 09:45PM EDT

https://doi.org/10.1145/3408877.3432580While many students now interact with web apps across a variety of smart devices, the vast majority of our Nifty Assignments still present traditional user interfaces such as console input/output and desktop GUI. In this tutorial session, participants will learn to build simple web apps for programming assignments that execute student-written code to dynamically respond to user interactions resulting in a more modern app experience. Our approach requires up to 75% less code than similar desktop GUI apps while requiring few (if any) modifications to existing assignments. Instructors and students alike can run and modify these web apps on their own computers or deploy their apps online for access from any smart device at no cost. The tutorial presents examples from CS1 and CS2 courses in Python and Java, but the ideas apply generally.

# Special Session: Terms to Know and Videos to Help: Gender-identity, Sex, Sexual Orientation, Pronouns, Race, Intersectionality, Privilege, & Bias
<https://pathable.sigcse2021.org/meetings/virtual/pB4XhheGfEvY3cXpq>

Friday at 08:00PM until 09:45PM EDT

https://doi.org/10.1145/3408877.3432581The goal of the session is to help attendees who are committed to diversity and inclusion learn to talk about different dimensions of identity (e.g., race, class, gender, sex, sexuality, etc.). The landscape of terms is always changing and we want SIGCSE attendees to feel more comfortable using current language to talk about issues related to diversity and inclusion. This special session will include eight short videos, individual reflection, and a Q&A with presenters. This is an expansion of a special session held at the NCWIT Summit in 2019 it was well received and we hope to offer it to the larger SIGCSE audience. The format also lends itself to attendees sharing the videos and discussions with their colleagues after SIGCSE, which are available at http://ncwit.org/intersectionality-videos

# Closing Keynote: Increasing Diversity in Computing Education: Lesson Learned
<https://pathable.sigcse2021.org/meetings/virtual/KGhizkvnpf3DRxkmB>

Saturday at 01:00PM until 02:00PM EDT

https://doi.org/10.1145/3408877.3432592It is recognized that diversity of perspectives results in solutions that serve a broad base. This is critical to the area of computing, which has applications to many areas including science, humanities, finance, as well as foundational work to advance the field of computing. Cultivating an environment that values and promotes diversity, however, is not an easy task. This is especially the case in higher education, with a focus on undergraduate and graduate computing education. In this talk, I will discuss lessons learned from the following CMD-IT programs: University Award, FLIP Alliance, and Academic Careers Workshops. The focus will be on effective strategies and challenges that require community engagement.
