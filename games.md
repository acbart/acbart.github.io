Here is information about tabletop games that I have created or developed with others.

# Christmas Noir

Step into the snowy shadows of the North Pole in this Powered by the Apocalypse mystery where candy-striped streets hide dark secrets. Denizens are vanishing, monsters stalk the night, and only a band of misfit villagers can uncover the truth. A blend of holiday magic and hard-boiled detective grit, Christmas Noir mixes cheer with coal. Are you ready for the holly jolly truth?

# Pico and the Void
