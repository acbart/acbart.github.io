<pre>Hello Mr. Bart,
This is Bob from class. My TA graded my assignment wrong. Please fix this immediately, since it is making me very anxious.
-Bob</pre>

Body: I keep running my code, but it comes back with an error. Could you help me?</pre>

`YOUR CLASSMATE asks the following question in the <code>#cisc108_general</code> Discord:
<pre>Hi, I have not made any progress on project 3. I just spent the past 12 hours working on it, and it still doesn't compile. Does anyone have any suggestions for what to do?</pre>
Prompt: What would you say to your classmate?`,

// Discord DM
`YOUR COHORTMATE sends you the following Direct Message on Discord:

<pre>Hey friend, I'm really sorry to have to ask, but could you send me your code for the final project? I just failed a math exam this morning and I'm completely exhausted. If I bomb this project then I'm going to lose my financial aid. I'll change the variable names and everything.</pre>

Prompt: What would you say to your cohortmate?`,

`YOUR CLASSMATE posts a question on Piazza, and A DIFFERENT CLASSMATE posts a student answer.

<pre>Question: Hi, I keep getting quiz #12, question 3 wrong. I think the answer is 24 (based on if you add the numbers together), but that apparently is not correct. Do I need to use a different operator?</pre>
<pre>Student Answer: Obviously, the answer is 8.</pre>

Prompt: What is wrong with the student answer?`,

`YOUR COHORTMATE says the following to a DIFFERENT COHORTMATE while you are all working on a Cohortwork assignment together.
<pre>Cohortmate: What? No, that's completely wrong. Here I'm just going to erase all of this and we'll do it correctly instead.</pre>
Prompt: What would you say to your Cohortmate?`,

`YOU show up to a TA's office hours on Zoom. It has been 20 minutes, and the TA still hasn't shown up. You check Canvas, but there are no new announcements and you are there at the right time.<br><br>
Prompt: What should you do?`,

`A CLASSMATE unmutes their mic near the start of lecture, and says the following:
<pre>Dr. Bart, I wanted to ask a question that's a little off-topic. When are we going to learn about list comprehensions this semester? I was reading up on them and they seem really similar to streams in Java, which I've found very useful in my phone apps.</pre>
Prompt: What is problematic about this question?`,
