# SIGCSE Escapes

Hi!

Do you like Escape Rooms? I sure do. While we're in St. Louis for SIGCSE'26, I plan to do an Escape Room. If you'd like to join me, keep reading!

The "Stadium Scare" room has a "Mostly Positive" rating on [Morty](https://morty.app/attraction/5110/stadium-scare):
> During a sold out game at the stadium, a maniacal character takes you and your friends hostage. He locks you in the bowels of the stadium and tells you a string of bombs will detonate in 1 hour minutes if not disarmed by your team.  To quench his thirst for twisted entertainment, he tells you where to start but not exactly how to turn it off. Working with up to at least 4 and up to 10 teammates and 60 heart-pumping minutes, can you disarm the bomb and save the crowd in time? Complete this medium difficulty stadium escape room, and the city will thank you. Fail, and and the stadium (and whatever is in it) will be destroyed.

It sounds like there'll be a lot of Cardinals and Baseball themed trivia, which I know very little about, so I'll be really relying on your help!

If you're interested in joining me, you can sign up using the form above. You can also use this form to signal more general interest, if you aren't sure you can make it.

I have no idea how many folks will be interested in this, so I can't make a promise about there being space for everyone. I can only guarantee that I will be there. I'll do my best to coordinate things with whoever fills out the form via text once we get to SIGCSE!
